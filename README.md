# Mini SQL Project

I explored data in the "country_club" database, which is a SQL-based. This database
contains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.

In this mini project, I answered a series of questions using SQL queries to aggregate and join data. The questions and the code for each solution is found in the sql file.
