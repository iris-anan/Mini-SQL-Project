# Mini SQL Project

I explored data in the "country_club" database, which is a SQL-based. This database
contains 3 tables: <br>
<p> i) the "Bookings" table </p>
    <p> ii) the "Facilities" table <br>
    <p> iii) the "Members" table <br>

In this mini project, I answered a series of questions using SQL queries to aggregate and join data. The questions and the code for each solution is found in the sql file.
